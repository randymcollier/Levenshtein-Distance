Project 2
The edit distance between two strings x and y is the MINIMUM number of edit operations required to transform x into y.
The commonly allowed edition operations include:
- insertion: insert a character into a string;
- deletion: delete a character from a string; and
- replacement: replace a character of a string by another character.
Write a Java program for edit distance. Your program should accept two input strings from key board and output the edit
distance along with the sequence of operations needed to transform one string to the other.
